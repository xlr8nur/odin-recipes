<p>With a few kitchen accessories you can make homemade pappardelle, a broad pasta noodle which welcomes a variety of different sauces. I chose to make a pesto cream sauce.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3/4 cup 00 flour, plus more for dusting</li>
    <li>1/4 cup semolina flour</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Combine 00 flour, semolina flour, and eggs in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until dough comes together.</li>
    <li>On a lightly floured cutting board, knead dough about 10 times with the palm of your hand. Cover dough with a damp towel, and rest for about 10 minutes. Shape dough into a disc. Wrap dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place dough on a lightly floured surface and dust with flour. Using a rolling pin, and starting in the middle of the dough, push away from you. Roll dough into a sheet, then tri-fold it like a letter: pick up one end of dough, fold it over 1/3 of the way, then bring the opposite end over 1/3 of the way. Continue rolling out dough until it is thin. Let rest 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Loosely roll dough like a cinnamon roll. Using a sharp knife, cut into 3/4-inch-wide slices. Unwrap noodles; dust with semolina, and gently toss to separate.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook noodles, until tender with a bite, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
</ol>
